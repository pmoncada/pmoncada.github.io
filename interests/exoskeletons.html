        Computers have massively augmented our natural cognitive abilities. We have essentially networked our brains into one collective nervous system, and as a result have the entirety of human knowledge at our fingertips and the ability to communicate with one another instantaneously across the world. The cognitive gains that we've experienced from computing are hard to overstate. However, it seems as though the gains in computing haven't had the same revolution in augmenting our physical capabilities.
