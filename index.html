        <h2>Projects</h2>
          <a href="https://moondao.com">MoonDAO</a>: The Internet's Space Program. An idea formed in 2022 to accelerate R&D for a long-term lunar presence. We sent the first DAO-voted person to space, and we're sending another person up soon!
          <br/><br/> <a href="https://pmoncada.notion.site/pmoncada/Junto-Decentralized-Autonomous-Libraries-b18f47157c49496caee861d753a1a9cb">Junto</a>: Decentralized Autonomous Library. This was a startup I was working on in 2021, the idea is to create resilient networks of local communities through better coordination. 
          <br/><br/> <a href="https://constitutiondao.com">ConstitutionDAO</a>: The Intenet tried (and failed) to purchase the U.S. Constitution from Sotheby's. We were outbid by a hedge fund CEO, but managed to raise the price to over $40 million dollars. This was the most intense week of my life trying to bring this idea to life.
          <br/><br/> <a href="https://www.dcgeorge.com/ProjectFalcon_f.html">Falcon</a>: A future project towards better personal flight using a wing-powered exoskeleton. Someday I hope this becomes a reality.

Today I'd categorize myself as Catholic, but I think there are many levels to spirituality and we are just on the surface of our understanding.
          <br/><br/><a href="https://mirror.xyz/pmoncada.eth/R9_-f3CnHw7CGEvq9uTHBK0a_Ru90qO2rw_JeEU04dA">Decentralized Autonomous Libraries</a>: Writing about Decentralized Libraries and how they might work in the future.
          <br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYhZ6YeDP18">Fireside Chat at DAODenver</a>: In 2022 I was invited to give a chat about MoonDAO, there are various other talks I've given about MoonDAO on YouTube but this was one of the first ones I did.
          <br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lHG1-nAckQ">Presentation about MoonDAO</a>: After the 5 minute mark or so I give a deeper presentation outlining how MoonDAO works and what we've achieved so far.
