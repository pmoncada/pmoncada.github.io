I'm Pablo Moncada-Larrotiz, I'm interested in developing new technologies that will make our lives better, and hopefully more fun too.

I currently live in San Francisco, where I work as a Software Engineer at Google. I was born in Michigan, my parents are from Spain, and I was raised in both places.

At Google I work on progressing the advent of 6DOF video for virtual reality, and exoskeletons for improving lower body mobility. Before Google, I worked at a biotech start up where I worked on a bioreactor to scale up the production of engineered human tissues.

I want to make an upper body exoskeleton to help us fly, I think about that a lot.
