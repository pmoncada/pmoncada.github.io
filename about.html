        <h1>About</h1>
        <br/>
        I'm Pablo Moncada-Larrotiz, I currently live in San Francisco and work as a Software Engineer at Google.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        At Google my main focus is on progressing the advent of 6DOF video for virtual reality, and exoskeletons for improving lower body mobility.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Previously, I worked at a biotech start up making a bioreactor to engineer human tissues.
        <br/>
        I studied Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering, but I have many interests outside of those two.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Currently, I think a lot about making an upper body exoskeleton to help us fly... That would be cool.
